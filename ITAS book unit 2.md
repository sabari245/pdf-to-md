## 2.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT MONITORING SYSTEM

The agricultural production environment monitoring system is an integrated approach that employs advanced technologies to monitor, analyze, and manage various environmental factors affecting agricultural production. The primary objective of such systems is to optimize crop growth, improve yields, and ensure sustainable farming practices by providing real-time data and actionable insights to farmers and agricultural managers.

Environment monitoring systems thoroughly monitor various environmental elements such as air temperature and humidity, light intensity, ultraviolet light, soil temperature and humidity, soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels, soil pH, and gases like carbon monoxide and oxygen. Tailored to the specific needs of the plantation area, the system is assembled to monitor the necessary environmental factors.

In greenhouses, environmental monitoring is primarily achieved through an agricultural greenhouse weather station. This station is linked to various monitoring devices that track air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels, light intensity, and various gases via the ModBus-RTU master station interface. It collects real-time data from these devices, displaying it on an LED screen in real time and simultaneously uploading the data to a monitoring platform using GPRS/4G.

These stations can monitor various meteorological elements such as air temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, light intensity, rainfall, different air quality parameters, and dust levels.
